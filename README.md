wunderbar is a status bar replacement for macOS, written in rust and using
native cocoa bindings. wunderbar will support workspace switching (with yabai
integration prioritized!), integrations with music players/spotify, dynamically
rendered icons for battery, wifi, etc, and more. wunderbar is heavily inspired
by [Sketchybar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar)!

> [!WARNING]
> i am hard at work developing wunderbar as quickly as possible, but it is still
> alpha software that is probably not ready for daily use so be careful!!!
